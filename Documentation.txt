1. Code Documentation:
Inline Comments: Explain the purpose of each function, block of code, or complex logic in your code using comments.
Descriptive Names: Use meaningful variable and function names that accurately describe their purpose.
Swagger: Utilize Swagger or similar tools to automatically generate API documentation from your code annotations.

In Django, you can achieve inline comments, descriptive names, and API documentation using the built-in commenting system,
meaningful naming conventions, and tools like Django Rest Framework (DRF) with Swagger or similar libraries. 
Let's break down how you can implement each of these:

Inline Comments:
In Django, you can add inline comments within your views, models, serializers, and other Python files to explain the logic 
and purpose of different sections of code. Here's an example of how you might use inline comments in a Django view function:

from django.http import JsonResponse

def register_user(request):
    """
    View function to register a new user.
    """
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Extract user registration data from request
        username = request.POST.get('username')
        email = request.POST.get('email')
        password = request.POST.get('password')

        # Validate user data
        # Implement validation logic here

        # Create a new user object
        # Save the new user to the database

        return JsonResponse({'message': 'User registered successfully'})
    else:
        return JsonResponse({'error': 'Invalid request method'}, status=405)

Descriptive Names:
Descriptive variable and function names are crucial for improving code readability and maintainability. Use meaningful names 
that accurately describe the purpose of variables, functions, and classes in your Django project. Here's an example:

class UserRegistrationSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    """
    Serializer for user registration.
    """
    username = serializers.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = serializers.EmailField()
    password = serializers.CharField(max_length=100)

Swagger (with Django Rest Framework):
Django Rest Framework (DRF) provides excellent support for building APIs in Django. You can integrate DRF with Swagger using 
packages like drf-yasg to automatically generate API documentation from your code annotations. Here's a basic example:

from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from drf_yasg.utils import swagger_auto_schema
from .serializers import UserRegistrationSerializer

class UserRegistrationView(APIView):
    """
    API endpoint for user registration.
    """
    @swagger_auto_schema(request_body=UserRegistrationSerializer)
    def post(self, request):
        """
        Register a new user.
        """
        serializer = UserRegistrationSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            # Create a new user
            # Return success response
            return Response({'message': 'User registered successfully'})
        else:
            # Return validation error response
            return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)

By following these practices in your Django project, you can ensure that your codebase remains well-documented, easy to 
understand, and maintainable, which is essential for successful development and collaboration.

2. Setup Instructions:
Development Environment Setup:
Install python and django
Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone <https://github.com/abhishek-khodke/User_Management_API_Project.git>
Navigate to the project directory: cd <https://github.com/abhishek-khodke/User_Management_API_Project>
Installing Dependencies:
Run django install to install all required dependencies.
Running the Application:
Start the server: django start.
The API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

3. API Usage Guide:
Endpoints:
User Registration:
Endpoint: /register
Method: POST
Description: Register a new user.
Request Body:
{
  "username": "example",
  "email": "example@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
Response:
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "username": "example",
    "email": "example@example.com"
  }
}

Authentication:
User Login:
Endpoint: /login
Method: POST
Description: Log in with username/email and password.
Request Body:
{
  "username": "example",
  "password": "password123"
}
Response:
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "auth_token"
}
OTP-based Login:
Endpoint: /otp-login
Method: POST
Description: Log in with OTP sent to email.
Request Body:
json
{
  "email": "example@example.com",
  "otp": "123456"
}
Response:
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "auth_token"
}

4. Frontend Integration Guide:
Integrating with Frontend:
Use fetch or axios to make HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints from your frontend.
Handle authentication by storing tokens (JWT) securely in local storage or cookies.
Include logic to send requests with the token in the Authorization header for authenticated routes.
By following these instructions, developers can easily set up the development environment, understand how to use the API endpoints, 
and integrate the frontend with the backend API effectively.
